# Contributing to WebScan
WebScan is an open project, and you can contribute to it in many ways. You can help with ideas, code, or documentation. We appreciate any efforts that help us to make the project better.

Thank you.

## How to Contribute to WebScan Documentation

1. The first step is to clone the master branch.
---
```shell
git clone git@github.com:digital-technology-agency/web-scan.git
```
2. The next step is to create a new branch for the problem that you want to solve and indicate the tag of the number of this problem.
---
  * **issue** - Type of problem to be solved 
  * **77** - Number of the problem to be solved
    
```shell
git checkout -b issue-77
```

3. Solve the problem using code and make a pull request from your branch to the master
---
- Go to the repository page on GitHub, select the **issue-77** branch and click the **Pull Request** button.
- Next, you will be taken to a preview page, where you can enter the name and description of your changes (the name will then go into the description of the merge commit and become public, please note this).
- There you can also see which commits were included in the pull request.
- On the left, select which branch changes **master** in the parent repository will be merged into, on the right, select your **issue-77** branch

### What's next?

Changing the base repository also changes the list of people who will receive a pull request notification.

When you have entered a name and description and double-checked the list of commits and changes to the files that were included in the pull request, click the Send pull request button. The pull request will be created immediately.

Follow your pull request. What people will comment on, what the maintainer will say, whether or not your pull request will be accepted.
